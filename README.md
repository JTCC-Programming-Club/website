## Vue

This application leverage [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) for the component structure you see in `src/`.

If you aren't familiar with Vue, that's okay. Have a look at the [guide](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide) on what it does and getting started.

## Project setup

This application is written using node.js. Download [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to get started.

Once installed, open your terminal in the folder where you downloaded this source code and run the command:

```
npm install
```

This will download the local web server, vue, and all the other dependencies needed to run the project.

### Start the server

This command compiles the source code and serves it up for you in the browser. It also does hot-reloading and basic error checking.
```
npm run serve
```

Once you run the command, copy the url it prints out and open in your browser to see the website


### Compile and minify for production

```
npm run build
```

### Lint and fix files

```
npm run lint
```

## Customize configuration

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
